The Reconfiguration Task and Motion Planner (TAMP) program is designed using Python, leveraging existing Python implementations\cite{EVASDK} for controlling the robotic arm \cite{evaSpec} available in the lab. The program inputs an initial and final state and outputs a list of instructions to reconfigure the initial state into the final state using a mobile manipulator.
\\\\
The TAMP system comprises three main components: the logic layer, the physical layer, and the feedback controller. Each component has a distinct role, allowing the discrete and continuous aspects of the solution search to be managed separately while ensuring integration and communication between layers through the feedback controller.
\begin{itemize}[]
	\item\textbf{Logic Layer:} Responsible for discrete task planning.
	\item\textbf{Physical Layer:} Manages continuous motion planning.
	\item\textbf{Feedback Controller:} Integrates the logic and physical layers, facilitating communication and iterative solution searching through feedback strategies.
\end{itemize}
The feedback strategies implemented by the feedback controller create a control loop behaviour, iteratively refining the solution. Once a feasible solution is found, it is formatted into the required instruction set by the output formatter.
