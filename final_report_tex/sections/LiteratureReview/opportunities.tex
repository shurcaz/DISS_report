\section{Gaps and Opportunities}
Modular reconfiguration defines a subclass of the generic planning problems usually addressed by TAMPs. Although research has previously demonstrated effective systems that can handle both symbolic and geometric reasoning, their application to robotic assembly and in particular robotic re-assembly is currently limited. There is additionally a distinct lack of discriminating modular blocks by type in existing algorithms which could potentially be easily implemented without a substantial hit to system performance.

The system proposed in figure \cite{9438257} is promising due to the robustness of solutions and flexibility of the logic layer, however, there lacks the extensive performance testing required to recognise weaknesses and future improvements, identifying why this system could not be used in real-world application currently.
